`Google made it very easy to create quizzes with Google Forms.
It is even more easy to insert questions: you just have to
copy and paste the content from a text editor or such to the
browser, where the form is open and its done. Google automagically
will convert each line into a new option.

But for some reason, it is not that easy to copy it back.
Some months ago, in a summer day, I had to deal with this huge
Google Forms (about 20 questions, each one of them with 5 multiple
options). What I needed was simple: export every single question
and their options to plain text.

Now calculate the manual work...

This script was created with that in mind.`
